A simple jumper game implemented with genetic algorithm

This program uses `pygame` library for graphical display.

The program will use genetic algorithm to play the game and find the best solution. After each generation, it displays the best solution so far.

TODO list:
  - tune parameters for the algorithm
  - refine the file structures
  - use multiprocessing so that the algorithm can calculate the next generation while displaying the current best solution
  - generalize `algorithm.py` for other games
